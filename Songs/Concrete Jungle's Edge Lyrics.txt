[Verse]
Rain falls down on pine and streets,
Tent cities where shadows meet.
Homeless prayers by neon lights,
Silicon dreams take flight.

[Verse 2]
Skyscrapers reach for cloudy skies,
Tech giants rise, programmed lives.
High taxes, crime hold tight,
Yet green forests lie in sight.

[Chorus]
Concrete jungle's edge, a tale of two,
Where the past and future brew.
Hard times mix with hope and gleam,
Seattle, you're more than just a dream.

[Verse 3]
Amazon boxes on every door,
Microsoft minds seeking more.
Living wages, wealthy streams,
Balancing life's vivid schemes.

[Bridge]
Eagles soar 'bove urban haze,
Nature's whispers through the maze.
Emerald City, dual extremes,
Hard to leave, despite the beams.

[Verse 4]
Morning coffee, mountain views,
Lost in tech, found in hues.
City heartbeat, gentle thrum,
Echoes of whatâ€™s yet to come.
